                When you start employing staff, you need to register as an employer with HMRC and set up a 
                PAYE (Pay As You Earn) scheme. This is a legal requirement that allows you to deduct Income Tax 
                and National Insurance contributions from your employees' wages.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
                Our experienced team handles all aspects of PAYE registration, payroll processing, Real Time 
                Information (RTI) submissions, and year-end compliance. We ensure your payroll runs smoothly 
                and accurately, giving you peace of mind and more time to focus on growing your business.

                    You must register as an employer with HMRC before the first payday if you employ staff 
                    earning over Â£123 per week, provide expenses or benefits, employ someone already receiving 
                    a pension or who has another job, or employ subcontractors working in construction.

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
                    Under RTI, employers must report pay and deductions to HMRC on or before each payday. 
                    This is done through Full Payment Submissions (FPS) and includes details of employee 
                    wages, tax, and National Insurance contributions.

                    All employers must automatically enrol eligible workers into a workplace pension scheme 
                    and make contributions. We help you set up a compliant pension scheme and manage ongoing 
                    auto-enrolment duties including re-enrolment every three years.
